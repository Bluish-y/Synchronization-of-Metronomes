# Synchronization-of-Metronomes
This details my simulations for a set of N metronomes system. We found novel limit cycles for large parameters of the non linear system. I was able to find quantitative and qualitative approximations for the unusual behaviour.

# Abstract
The Van der Pol equation is one of the most significant dynamic behaviour in the study of non-linear dynamics. The unique limit cycle that the Van der Pol system possesses is an intensively studied research area. A set of metronomes are a good model for such a Van der Pol system, and in fact use small angle approximations to produce the unique limit cycle. Our study focused on a set of metronomes residing on a swing, to model a forced Van der Pol system of equations. For small angles, the Van der Pol system expectedly produced similar results in the phase space after transient behaviour when the metronomes synchronise. Large angles, such as those larger than two right angles, are outside the domain for which these equations represent a physical system. However, for large initial conditions where the system enters the domain of such large angles, brute mathematical simulations surprisingly showed existence of new limit cycles in the phase space. This paper tries to give a qualitative explanation for the existence of the novel limit cycles and quantitatively approximate the behaviour of simpler cases.
